The system is divided into three major layers:

* **Mapping** — converts external data into a relational representation.
* **Engine / Relational** — owns relational state, correctness, and execution.
* **Validation** — evaluates business rules independently of committed relational state.

---

# Mapping

The Mapping layer transforms external data into relational rows.

It consists of four stages:

* Discovery
* Import
* Schema Inference
* Database Construction

Discovery traverses arbitrary hierarchical data and produces immutable `DiscoveryResult`s. Discovery is composed of `DiscoveryNode`s, `DiscoveryNavigator`s, and optional `DiscoveryDecoder`s, allowing the same model to operate across filesystems, JSON, and other structured sources.

Import consumes discovery results using `ImportNode`s and `ImportMapping`s. Expressions transform captured values into relational fields while automatic inference handles common mapping scenarios.

Schema inference observes imported values to construct relational schema.

Finally, `DatabaseBuilder` combines schema and imported rows into immutable relational objects.

---

# Import Pipeline

`ImportPipeline` orchestrates the complete mapping process.

It returns an `ImportPipelineResult` containing:

* discoveries
* imports
* schema
* databases

This exposes intermediate stages for tooling and debugging while supporting installation through:

```ts
engine.install(result.databases);
```

---

# Engine and Relational

The Engine owns committed relational state and executes SQL.

The Relational module provides the immutable relational representation and structural correctness mechanisms used by the Engine.

Primary runtime components include:

* `Engine`
* `Transaction`
* `ExecutionContext`
* `Databases`
* `Database`
* `Table`

Semantic analysis resolves schema references and compiles expressions, predicates, mutations, and queries before execution.

Semantic analysis also resolves engine and dialect policy used by schema-modification actions.

Mutations produce immutable `Action`s.

Queries produce immutable `QueryPlan`s evaluated against relational snapshots and `RowView`s.

`INSERT ... SELECT` combines these execution models: semantic analysis binds the source query into a `QueryPlan`, and an `InsertSelectAction` evaluates that plan and inserts the resulting rows through the relational insertion path.

Relational constraints enforce structural integrity during execution.

---

# DSL

The DSL provides fluent builders for:

* discovery
* import mappings
* SQL statements
* expressions
* predicates

Runtime builders evaluate directly against typed contexts, while SQL builders construct ASTs for semantic analysis.

Expression nodes provide reusable fluent operations for composing expressions and predicates. Expression-producing arithmetic operations and predicate-producing comparisons are available across applicable expression nodes rather than being limited to column references.

---

# Validation

Validation is intentionally separate from relational storage and structural integrity.

The Relational layer enforces constraints required for relational correctness.

The Validation layer defines additional business rules and evaluates them against an existing relational database.

Validation rules reuse constraint statements and the existing SQL/semantic infrastructure. They execute inside transactions and roll back after evaluation, producing structured `ValidationReport`s rather than changing committed state.

---

# Core Invariants

* Tables and databases are immutable.
* Actions, query plans, expressions, and predicates operate without mutating committed state.
* Query execution does not mutate committed state.
* Schema references are resolved before execution.
* Referential propagation operates against immutable relational state.
* Structural validation belongs to the Relational/Engine layer.
* Business validation belongs to the Validation layer.
* Discovery is independent of import and relational schema.
